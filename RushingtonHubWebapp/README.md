This is a desktop and mobile website for use with a Minecraft Realm (basically server) I have with friends. It was deployed for free with Firebase, which is also what hosts the database. Users are given pseudorandom “Citizen ID” in game they keep secret and use to sign in to website (I understand that authentication is not robust security-wise. Since this is just a fun little thing with a few users that stores no real-world information except names, not even real times and dates, we're all ok with it. If this was ever opened up for widespread use, I'd change a lot security-wise). Users can make, like, dislike, and comment on posts, and see government announcements, public criminal charges, notifications, their bank balance, make bank transfers, create businesses, add products to businesses, buy/order from businesses, buy licenses, see a map of the world, see Constitution, see calendar (with own time and date system), and see user profiles. Told unprompted it was “so easy to use” and the “best website for a Minecraft server.”

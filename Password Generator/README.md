Just a quick little thing I made in C++ to make my passwords more secure. I open the .exe and it asks for the service I want a password for, and it shows me the random alphanumeric password it generated and appends that to a .txt file on my C drive. I'm thinking about setting up a personal website that has a database that I store an encrypted version of the passwords on with a key that I remember based on the first letters of lyrics from a song of mine or something and don't write down anywhere. So it'd basically accomplish what those password managers do for free.

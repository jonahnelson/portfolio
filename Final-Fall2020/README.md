Android app that allows user to sign in with Google, compare popularity of names from year to year parameters, and rate and save names to their Google account. Accomplished with only Firebase's realtime database feature. A storage bucket was unnecessary for this.

My contribution was an algorithm that formatted a >200,000 keys JSON of names, popularity, etc. in a way that would be usable with the purpose of the app, and comparing popularity of, saving, rating, deleting, viewing, and altering saved rating of names. I did most of the work with this one in a group of four again despite equally dividing up the work and constant communication, so I learned a lot.

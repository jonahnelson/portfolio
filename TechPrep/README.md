This is a project from fall 2020. The point of the app overall is to practice interviewing, but the functionality we (a group of four) implemented was:
- User can record videos in response to a theoretical question
- After recording, user can rerecord or save the video to their account, having the option to name the video
- User can access, rewatch, and delete their saved videos, seeing theoretical comments from critiquing admins under the videos

We accomplished the functionality with Firebase and Firebase's nice API for Android. I handled the recording of the videos, the uploading to the storage bucket on Firebase to be accessed later from the realtime database, and rewatching the listed videos. One other partner and I ended up handling pretty much the entire project despite dividing the work evenly, so I learned a lot. Not a very pretty app, but it accomplished the functionality it needed to. I've gotten better with styling since then.
